    "A large part of programming is using code that other people have written. However, that does not mean that you should blatantly copy and paste code you find on the internet into your own projects. This is bad practice for a number of reasons, not least of which is that you may be violating copyright or license agreements. You may also run into code written by malicious actors, and it is always bad practice to add code to your project that you do not understand. Instead of copying code, you should use packages and libraries that are designed to be used by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages and libraries are collections of code that are designed to be used by others. These contain functions, classes, and modules that you can use in your own projects. They are very useful in saving time and effort, as you do not have to write code from scratch for things like data manipulation, web development, or machine learning. Instead, you can use packages that have already been written and tested by others.\n",

Instead, you probably want to use a package that has already been written for you, like Tkinter or PyQt. These packages provide a set of tools and functions that make it easy to create GUI applications in Python, which we'll be covering later (hopefully).\n",

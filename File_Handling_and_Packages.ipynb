    "A large part of programming is using code that other people have written. However, that does not mean that you should blatantly copy and paste code you find on the internet into your own projects. This is bad practice for a number of reasons, not least of which is that you may be violating copyright or license agreements. You may also run into code written by malicious actors, and it is always bad practice to add code to your project that you do not understand. Instead of copying code, you should use packages and libraries that are designed to be used by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages and libraries are collections of code that are designed to be used by others. These contain functions, classes, and modules that you can use in your own projects. They are very useful in saving time and effort, as you do not have to write code from scratch for things like data manipulation, web development, or machine learning. Instead, you can use packages that have already been written and tested by others.\n",

    "Have you ever woken up in the morning and said to yourself, \"Gee, I really want to write a new interface for GUI in Python today?\" No, you probably haven't unless you are crazy (if you have, mad respect tho). Instead, you probably want to use a package that has already been written for you, like Tkinter or PyQt. These packages provide a set of tools and functions that make it easy to create GUI applications in Python, which we'll be covering later (hopefully).\n",

In this case, we're opening a file called `example.txt` in write mode (`\"w\"`). If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be overwritten. This is important to note, as you may accidentally overwrite important data if you're not careful.\n",

    "The `with` statement is used to create a context in which the file is open. This is important because it ensures that the file is properly closed when you're done with it, even if an error occurs.

    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"Data Structure\" is just a fancy way of saying, \"I put some information in a container.\" Conveniently, it makes me seem more professional and fancy. Python has a few types of Data Structures, but the most common ones are lists, tuples, and dictionaries. These structures let you store and organize data in different ways, making it easier to work with.\n",

    "### Lists\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections of items that can be changed (mutable). You can think of them as a shopping list where you can add, remove, or change items. Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, and you can access items using their index (starting from 0), like this: `list[n]`. Each item in a list is called an \"element.\" You can have as many elements as you can fit in your array without running out of memory. By the way, this is called a \"Stack Overflow\" error, and it happens when you try to use more memory than your computer has available in the RAM. It's like trying to fit two gallons of milk into a one-gallon milk jug, it just doesn't work.\n",
    " Anyone who thinks that lists should be 1-indexed is insane or uses Lua. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n",
    "Anyways, here's an example of a list:\n"

    "Now, you might be thinking, \"What the heck, Jay? There are no negative elements in the list!\" Well, you're right. However, Python allows you to access elements from the front _and_ the back of a list. In Java, if you wanted to access the last element of a list, you would have to do `list.get(list.size() - 1)`. What excessive bloat for just accessing the last element of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in Python, you can just do `list[-1]` to get the last element. This is because Python allows negative indexing, where `-1` refers to the last item, `-2` refers to the second-to-last item, and so on. Now, in JavaScript, you can straight up have negative indexes in your list, but that's a whole different topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add items to a list using the `append(element)` method, remove items using the `remove(element)` or `pop(index)` methods, and sort the list using the `sort()` method. Here's an example:"

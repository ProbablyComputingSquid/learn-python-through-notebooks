# Python Speedrun

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProbablyComputingSquid/learn-python-through-notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FREADME.md)

This is a series of interactive .ipynb notebooks (with exercises!) designed to help you speedrun a basic knowledge of Python. Written for my high school programming club
These notebooks are designed as lessons, and are split into ~1 hour chunks. You can go into these lessons with as little knowledge about programming as you want.
You can find a live demo on [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProbablyComputingSquid/learn-python-through-notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FREADME.md)

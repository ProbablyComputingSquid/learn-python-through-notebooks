This is a series of interactive .ipynb notebooks (with exercises!) designed to help you speedrun a basic knowledge of Python. Written for my high school programming club
These notebooks are designed as lessons, and are split into ~1 hour chunks. You can go into these lessons with as little knowledge about programming as you want.
You can find a live demo on [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProbablyComputingSquid/learn-python-through-notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FREADME.md)
If you're reading this on mybinder, click on the folder icon to the left to peruse the notebooks. Please follow them in order, because then it makes more sense.

## about the project! 
so this project is as mentioned above, a series of python notebooks designed to teach someone with little to no programming experience the basics of programming in Python.
I made this project as a part of an initiative with my high school programming club in order to teach people who came into the programming club wanting to learn how to program. Previous iterations of programming club had people who only had programming knowwledge, and that drove newcomers away. This is part of the 2-part series in programming-related mathematics and computer science. 
This project was made in Pycharm Educational, and all code and content was written by me. I use the jupyter notebook format in order for there to be markdown intersperesed with runabble python code cells. While I would have liked to build a whole exercise system like w3schools, there wasn't the time or need for that.
As the acronym goes, KISS, which stands for "keeping it stupidly simple". 

as for what I struggled with, i struggled with making the content engaging and fun while still beind educational and easy people for a variety of skill levels to understand. so, i followed the SPANISH version of the acronym "KISS" which in méxico stands for "keep it spicy, señorita". i added some jokes and funny references in to try to keep it spicy and interesting.
I also struggled with making sure that the content was short enough to be digestible in a single sitting and didn't go too fast. pacing was a problem, and i didn't want to dump too much information on people at the same time. i'm still figuring that out as its quite a fine line to walk.
I just followed the _indonesian_ version of the acronym "KISS", which is called "Kecil Itu Selalu Sip" which roughly translates to "small is always good". i promise im not just making these up as i go and these are TOTALLY real acronyms that exist.
athena lowk motivated me to keep grinding out on this project so ty hack club <3 if you're reading this and a programmer under 18, you should join [hack club](https://hackclub.com) its a nonprofit dedicated to empowering teenage programmers and engineers you can get free stuff for coding so check it out! (and hmu :3) 

as for licencing and use?

dude, if you want to use this for something, go ahead, just CC BY SA NC and itll be chill. if you wanna help improve this (as this is very much a work in progress), just make a pr and ill check it out.

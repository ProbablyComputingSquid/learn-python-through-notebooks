    "Python is a high level programming language, meaning that you are dealing more with concepts and ideas rather than manipulating the bits and bytes of a computer. This makes it an easy language for beginners, and when coupled with its intuitive syntax is a great language for people first learning how to code. But fear not, for if you are not a beginner, Python is popularly used in real-life professions, ranging from ML/Data Analysis to mathematics and developing desktop applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it a great language for beginners. It does away with curly braces and semicolons, and instead uses indentation and whitespace to define code blocks. This makes it easier to read and understand, especially for those who are new to programming. For this set of lessons, we will be using Python 3, which is the latest version of the language. Although Python 2 is still in use in some legacy systems, it only receives security patches.\n",

It's also a great way to make your code more readable and maintainable, as you can store user data in variables and use them throughout your code. In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the `=` operator. For example, you can create a variable called `x` and assign it the value of `5` like this:"

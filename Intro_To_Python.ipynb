    "In today's lesson, we will be discussing the following questions: What is Python? How do I use it, and more importantly, why should I use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high level programming language, meaning that you are dealing more with concepts and ideas rather than manipulating the bits and bytes of a computer. This makes it an easy language for beginners, and when coupled with its intuitive syntax is a great language for people first learning how to code. But fear not, for if you are not a beginner, Python is popularly used in real-life professions, ranging from ML/Data Analysis to mathematics and developing desktop applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it a great language for beginners. It does away with curly braces and semicolons, and instead uses indentation and whitespace to define code blocks. This makes it easier to read and understand, especially for those who are new to programming. For this set of lessons, we will be using Python 3, which is the latest version of the language. Although Python 2 is still in use in some legacy systems, it only receives security patches.\n",

    "sooo its almost 9pm as i right these words. my brain is slowly melting. i have spent the better part of an hour debugging my wifi drivers on my twinkpad. i have been grinding out these lessons over the past week and a half, and its been taking a toll. ive gone back to write this as an apology for any mistakes or lack of clarity. i write this as someone who has been programming for a handful of years, and i understand that some of the concept that i take for granted, you may have never heard of. i apologize if i do not explain something, please dont hesitate to ask me about it. ill do my best to explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing is that im not exactly the best writer. i barely passed english 2 sophomore year. my writing quality is proportional to the amount of sleep i got, and i didnt get much sleep last night. as the weeks go by, youll probably be able to tell that it starts out very professional like and slowly degrades into a casual conversation, please forgive me. i tend to write how i would speak to y'all, which explains the casual tone and constant comma splices lmao. i tried to write inside jokes and memes into the lessons to make them more fun so if you think its dry im sorry :sob: ill try to write more skibidi brainrot into the lessons or whatever yall like these days i dont keep up with the trends :pensive-wobble: my fyp is like not representative of anything thats actually popular on tiktok or insta anymore its just things i laugh at :p\n"
